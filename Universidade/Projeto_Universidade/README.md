# Projeto Universidade

This repository contains a collection of my personal projects, tests, and study materials focused on front-end web development. The goal is to centralize examples and practical exercises I've created to help understand essential concepts like HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and more.

## Contents:
- Personal projects and tests to improve front-end development skills
- Code examples demonstrating various design techniques
- Commented solutions to aid in my learning and implementation

## How to Use:
- Browse through the directories to find the projects, tests, or examples you want to explore.
- Read the code and run it in your browser to see the results.
- Check the comments in the code to understand the logic and styling applied.
